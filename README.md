# ~~Svelte~~ Vue3 + Tauri + *Gun (plan only)*
An app - web cross (no android, iphone) - practice with new tech that I want to practice
## Tauri for app packaging
-- for now just for heavy phrase of the app (3rd process call, image processing, editing, ...)
## Gun for DB
-- decentralized DB - p2p - I'm going to learn by doing something on it (storing files, data, state, auth, ...)
## ~~Svelte~~ Vue3 for frontend
Stop trying using svelte - since I can't make a simple library component for svelte - I'll back to svelte when it more stable for creating library
-- one of my favorites web library

Using vue3 for now since its the one that I can successfully created and use my own library (svelte first and false, vue3 now working, react still in planning)
