# Svelte + Gun + Tauri
An app - web cross (no android, iphone) - practice with new tech that I want to practice
## Tauri for app packaging
-- for now just for heavy phrase of the app (3rd process call, image processing, editing, ...)
## Gun for DB
-- decentralized DB - p2p - I'm going to learn by doing something on it (storing files, data, state, auth, ...)
## Svelte for frontend
-- one of my favorites web library
